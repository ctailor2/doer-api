TODO: Plan for migrating the data to the next version of the todo list model

1) Update the current empty v1 snapshot to an empty v2 snapshot to keep the new code compiling
and working with the new version. If the v1 snapshot can be deserialized appropriately
to v2 snapshot, this may be as simple as updated the timestamp on the snapshot to now.
2) Make the migrator use the deprecated event sourced repos (todolistmodel and completedtodolist) to
produce a v2 todolistmodel, produce a snapshot, and save it.
